📊 Global Superstore Analysis – Project Summary

The Global Superstore Analysis project focuses on analyzing sales, profit, and customer behavior of a multinational retail company operating across multiple regions. The main objective of this analysis is to identify opportunities to increase sales, improve profitability, and understand factors that negatively impact profit.
This project uses historical transactional data to evaluate overall business performance and support data-driven decision-making.

✅ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard highlights several important KPIs to measure business success:

* Total Sales & Total Profit: Represents the overall revenue and profit generated by the company.
* Profit Margin: Indicates how much profit is earned from sales after deducting costs.
* Return Rate: Measures the percentage of returned orders, helping identify quality or logistics issues.
* Order Volume: Shows customer demand across regions and segments.

🔍 Main Areas of Analysis

* Geographical Performance:
  Sales and profit are analyzed across regions such as APAC, Europe, and the United States to identify high-performing and underperforming markets.

* Product Category Analysis:
  The Technology category (e.g., Phones and Copiers) generates higher profit margins, while Furniture, especially Tables, shows lower profitability due to high shipping and discount costs.

* Customer Segment Analysis:
  Performance is compared across Consumer, Corporate, and Home Office segments to understand which segment contributes most to revenue and profit.

* Shipping & Discount Impact:
  The analysis shows that while higher discounts can increase sales volume, they often reduce overall profit. Shipping modes and costs also have a significant impact on profitability.
